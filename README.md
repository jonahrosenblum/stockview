# StockView

A Chrome Extension that makes it easier to find out how a company you are reading
about is doing in the stock market.

## How it Works
- Goes through all text elements of a web page 
- Attempts to determine if a word in a text element is a company name, looks for both tickers and full names (Apple and APPL would be both valid company names).
- Inserts a link element where the company name was that when clicked will open a new tab for that company's Yahoo Finance page.

## Installation
To download this extension simply get it for free
